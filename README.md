## 🍄 Philosophy

This project is meant to be simple and easy to use. Keep features minimal but polished.
We do not want this project to be yet another bulky cms site, instead it aims for minimalism.

On top of that, hosting should be as cheap and simple as possible. 

All our plans include access to hundreds of Gojo CMS apps on cloud infrastructure, including hosting.Our service includes unlimited access to our support by email, from Monday to Friday, 24/5, in English and many more languages comming soon. Access to our eLearning platform is free too. Upgrades are also included in all our plans at no extra fee.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Due to being a managed and developed by as solo junior fullstack sofftware developer features may be buggy or laggy.
- To keep it cheap to host, amount of requests need to be kept to a minimum.
